## 67-442: Flashcards app
---
A demonstration of tab controller via a flashcard app with multiple decks that was demo'ed in class Fall 2016.  Key teaching points were regarding the use of multiple view controllers and seques as well as using tab bar and navigation controllers.  The app is not fully developed or tested and more tabs could certainly be added as well as a scoring system to track learning (students are free to do that themselves).

The original idea for the app was based very roughly on a similar app by Brainscape, [Ruby on Rails Flashcards](https://www.brainscape.com/learn/ruby-on-rails).
